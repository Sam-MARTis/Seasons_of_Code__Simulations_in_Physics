# Seasons of Code

### Project: Simulations in Physics

Over a period of 8 weeks, I am going to fill this repo with projects and progress! 
Interesting simulations might even get their own websites if I have time! 

Going to write the high-performant code in Fortran!


Step 1: Learn fortran. Check!

Step 2: Complete Week 0 Assignment. Check!

Step 3: Completed Week 1 Assignment, learn to plot using gnuplot, write reusable, modular code... CHECK!

Step 5: Pick an open-ended project topic! Thinking of one rn.


Ad astra!
