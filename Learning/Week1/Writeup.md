# Progress for this week!

More fortran! Lots of it! I learnt how to use modules, functiona and subroutines more extensively. 

I learnt to use GNUPLOT with fortran and made this:

It was an assignment and I did not know gnuplot would be so easy to use!


Fortunately, I made a lot of code reusable so I didn't have to write a lot of repeated stuff. Notice how there's virtually no difference in the lorentz attractor and rk4 method codes. 

I just had to change the DE and initial conditions and use the plot3D file instead of plot 2D.

Completed quite a few numerical methods and now for the rest of the week I'm going to look into CFD Lattice boltzman methods for simulations
