Note, the plots are not heatmaps in the executables.

For some unknown reason the interpolate module doesn't work for me(ubuntu 24.04). It says it failed to load a package(I've torubleshooted this, yes. More often than not, i can fix issues like that).

I ran a vm with ubuntu 20.04 and ran the code without issues. The images are from the VM
